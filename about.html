        <p>
            Eduardo Enrique’s practice examines contemporary forms of ideology and the cultural mechanisms through which
            they are produced, disseminated, and reinforced. Spanning sculptural assemblage, installation, graffiti, and
            industrial manufacturing, his work explores the intersections of consumer culture and geopolitical power
            structures. By recontextualizing branded goods and corporate symbols, Enrique exposes how capital abstracts
            itself into systems of meaning, instrumentalizing consumption to embed and perpetuate social and political
            structures.

            A former strategist with a background in advertising and cultural strategy, his practice engages branding as
            both medium and subject, operating within the very systems it critiques. The ‘Swoosh,’ a recurring motif in
            his
            work, serves as a real-time interrogation of cultural power, exposing the ideological inscriptions embedded
            in
            everyday commodities and the economic hierarchies they sustain.
